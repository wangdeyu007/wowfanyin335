## ✨ Features

|---------|-------------|
| 🌍 **Multi-Language** | Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Russian → English (and vice-versa) |

| ⚡ **Instant Cache** | Previously seen translations are instant |
| 💬 **Outgoing Translation** | Type in English, send in Chinese (or other languages) |
| 🔗 **Hyperlink Safe** | Player names, items, and quests stay clickable and are translated|
| 🔗 **Hyperlink Caching** | Quests are auto translated internally from WoW, for Items a cache is populated|

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Download

**[⬇️ Download Latest Release](../../releases/latest)**

The download includes everything: DLL + Addon in one package.

### 2. Install

Extract and copy to your WoW folder:

```
YourWoWFolder/
├── WoW.exe
├── WoWTranslate.dll        ← From the download
├── dlls.txt                ← Add "WoWTranslate.dll" to this file
└── Interface/
    └── AddOns/
        └── WoWTranslate/   ← From the download
```

> **Note:** If `dlls.txt` doesn't exist, create it and add `WoWTranslate.dll` on the first line.

> You have to run via `VanillaFixes.exe` or any other WoW dll launcher.

>There is a possibility that your AV flags the dll, if this happens you have to add the dll to exclusions. 

**Done!** A minimap button (scroll icon) appears — click it to open settings. Chat messages will now appear translated.

## 📖 Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/wt show` | Open configuration panel |
| `/wt on` / `/wt off` | Enable/disable translation |
| `/wt status` | Show status and credits |
| `/wt test` | Test translation |
| `/wt outgoing on` | Enable outgoing translation |
| `/wt clearcache` | Clear translation cache |


You can use the following Macro in-game to create an Outgoing Translation toggle:

`/run if not WT_Toggle then WT_Toggle = true ChatFrameEditBox:SetText("/wt outgoing on") else WT_Toggle = nil ChatFrameEditBox:SetText("/wt outgoing off") end ChatEdit_SendText(ChatFrameEditBox)
`

## 🔧 How It Works

```
┌─────────────┐    ┌─────────────┐    ┌─────────────┐
│  Glossary   │ →  │    Cache    │ →  │  Translate  │
│  (instant)  │    │   (free)    │    │ (also free) |
└─────────────┘    └─────────────┘    └─────────────┘
```

1. **Glossary** — WoW terms translated instantly (raids, bosses, slang)
2. **Cache** — Seen before? Instant and free
3. **Google Translate**

## 🎮 Language Settings

Open settings with `/wt show`:

- **Incoming**: What language to translate FROM (Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Russian, English)
- **Outgoing**: Enable translation for Say, Party, Guild, Whisper, etc.
- **Channel Filtering**: Toggle individual channels (Say, Yell, Whisper, Party, Guild, Raid, Battleground, World/Local, Hardcore) for both incoming and outgoing
- **AFK Pause**: Translation pauses while AFK (off by default, configurable)

---

## ❓ Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| DLL not loading | Ensure `WoWTranslate.dll` is next to `WoW.exe` and listed in `dlls.txt` |
| No translations | Run `/wt status` to check DLL loaded, then `/wt test` |
| Launcher issues | Run `WoW.exe` directly instead of through a launcher |
